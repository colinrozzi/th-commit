# Summary of Changes to the Theater Commit Tool

I've improved the UI/UX styling of your th-commit tool with the following changes:

## 1. Added a New UI Module
- Created a dedicated UI module for consistent styling
- Implemented functions for different types of formatted output
- Added color-coded output for different types of messages

## 2. Enhanced Visual Presentation
- Added a proper logo header with box drawing characters
- Implemented clear section divisions with titles
- Created a special framed box for commit messages
- Color-coded different message types (success, warning, error)
- Used proper spacing for a cleaner, more readable output

## 3. Improved Structure
- Added timing information to track execution duration
- Organized output into logical sections (Operation Progress, Results, Change Summary)
- Made error messages more visually distinct
- Added a clear completion message with duration

## 4. Technical Improvements
- Made the UI consistent throughout the application
- Used terminal width awareness to adapt to different terminal sizes
- Added support for formatting strings of different types

## Building and Testing
- To build and test the changes, use:
  ```bash
  cargo build
  cargo run
  ```

## Next Steps
If you'd like to further improve the UI, consider:
1. Adding interactive mode to review commit messages before finalizing
2. Implementing a progress spinner for longer operations
3. Adding support for custom themes
4. Implementing verbose/quiet mode options

The tool should now have a much more professional and visually appealing appearance while providing the same functionality as before.
